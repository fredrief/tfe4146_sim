# TFE 4146 sim

This project builds on the python package [Sesame](https://sesame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) and contains examples for numerical simulations of p-n junctions. The examples are developed as support material to the course TFE 4146 Semiconductor Devices at NTNU.

For simplicity, only the required part of the sesame source code is copied into the repository, such that no installation of sesame is required. Please refer to the [Sesame](https://sesame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) documentation for a detailed description of the simulation back-end.

## Installation
Open a terminal window and navigate into a directory where you want to run the python simulations, e.g.:

    cd /path/to/your/work/directory

Clone this repository.
With ssh:

    git clone git@github.com:fredrief/tfe4146_sim.git

or using the web url:

    git clone https://github.com/fredrief/tfe4146_sim.git

Install the required dependencies

    cd tfe4146_sim
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

See the comments in the examples.
